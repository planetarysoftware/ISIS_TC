## Agenda / Notes

- Introduction
  - Expectations
    - Do not share the raw data
      - Victor will share an edited version with some LRO folks
    - All these notes will be public
    - Go over things outside of meetings
    - Meetings are for discussion
  - Goals
    - Proposal to be present to the ISIS TC and the ASC management (and the public)
    - Maybe we need to make another survey
    - Form the large amount of differing opinions, perspectives, and stakeholders into something usable
    - What needs to happen to make a name change successful (if we decide it should happen)
  - Timeline
    - Proposal scheduled June 9th 1PM Pacific/MST
      - Date is good
    - Future meetings
      - Expect at least one more working group meeting is required
      - 6 weekly meetings seems like too much
      - Schedule meeting as we go based on required work
      - Table to end of meeting
  - Collaborating
    - ASC folks have access to shared excel forms
    - We could use a google sheet from a personal e-mail

- ~Buckets~ Labels
  - It would be good to make a separate tab for labeling each question
  - Labels instead of categories
      - Margarette is a student, cartographer, and archivist
      - ISIS is a culturally insensitive name and it has impacted me personally
  - Why yes/no
    - We did not ask "how strongly do you feel about this"
      - We will need to infer this from the response
    - We should be careful about what we read into people's responses
    - List from Laz
      - I don't see any problem and don't believe there is a problem
      - This has not impacted me, but I can see how it impacts others
      - ISIS is a culturally insensitive name
      - Changing the name means giving into the terrorist group and their agenda
      - It is a hassle for me, but I do not feel strongly about it
      - It takes too much work/hassle to change the name
      - ISIS is a horrible name
      - ISIS is a confusing name and causes mix-ups
      - Yes this impacted me personally
        - Personal experiences could get wiped out by the broader community that is not impacted
      - no feedback/not useful feedback
        - "why didn't we do this 10 years ago!"
  - Demographics
    - List from Laz & Lauren
      - Mission/Instrument Team
      - Software/Pipeline Developer
      - Research Scientist/Professor
      - Student
        - Does this just belong in an academia category with professor?
      - Cartographer/Geodesist
      - Data Archivist
      - Other
        - Catch all for no response or ambiguous response
      - Astro
        - This question was not on the ASC internal survey
        - Should this be in the Other bucket?
          - ISIS originated at ASC
          - responses are more personal
          - responses slightly more biased towards no than the broader community
          - ASC folks may weight the effort required to change the name more heavily

  - Post pone addressing responses to these until we answer the "should this happen question"
    - New Names
    - User Impact
    - Communication

  - There will need to be a lot more technical details sorted out than what is commented in the survey
  - What about people who didn't have an opinion and didn't respond to the survey?
    - The majority of users are probably in this category

## Discussions for next meeting

- What do we see in the data?
- Decision making

## Action Items
