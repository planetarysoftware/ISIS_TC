    - Updated labels based on discussions last meeting
    - New labeling questions:
      - From Lauren and Laz
      - Resolved in meeting
        - Changed some response labels
        - Revomed "Does not impact me" from "I can see impact on others" label
  - Jesse: comb impact list
    - Not done
    - Defer to next meeting
  - Jesse: make some charts
    - Done
    - Added summative values
    - Manually combined Other demographic category

- How does the data answer our questions?
  - Modal responses
    - "I don't see any problem" is the largest No response
    - "Terrorist oragnization links" is the largest Yes response
      - "culturally insensitive" and "impact on others" combine with/are caused by this
    - Do we need to respond to "changing the name is ceding to the terrorist organization" and "it's too much work"?
      - We need to scope the work for ASC management
      - "changing the name is ceding to the terrorist organization" defer response to ASC management. Only 4 responses
  - We had 8 responses that were personally impacted
    - The degree of impact varies
    - Many respondents felt uncomfortable or made small changes to their behavior
    - All 8 responses were in favor of changing the name
  - Responses by demographic
    - Astro vs non-Astro responses
      - Astro skewed much more against renaming
        - Could be familiarity and thoughts on how much work it is
      - Hard to explain the Research Scientist/Research Professor group
      - Mission and instrument teams tend to contain a large group of people from many different professional backgrounds
      - No group is an extreme outlier
- What do we propose?
  - Responses justify at a minimum scoping the effort
  - We should change the name as long as the level effort is feasible by the ASC and the ISIS TC
    - The response is strong enough to merit a response to this issue even if it is not a full and complete renaming
  - There is clear community interest in this
  - There is a wide variety of reasons for renaming
    - There are significantly more reasons for renaming than not renaming
  - Reasons for renaming are generally stronger than the reasons not to rename
- Next steps
  - Meeting with ISIS TC and ASC management in 3 weeks
  - What are we making our proposal in?
    - Slides
  - Impact analysis
    - Also need to determine what this is
    - How do we estimate user/community impact?
    - Need to comb the data
  - Alternate name
    - No consensus in the data
    - There may be general agreement on broader ideas
    - What do we want to propose?
      - Would prefer to lean towards action happening so we should try to suggest at least a set of possible names
        - Maybe new community survey asking which of the set
