## Working Group Moderation Policy Template

Every Working Group must have a Moderation Policy. By default,
all repositories under the ASC Software GitHub Organization fall under
the [ASC Software Organization Moderation Policy][], but Working Groups can choose to
define their own alternative policy. If the Working Group does choose
it's own Moderation Policy, it must be documented in a `ModerationPolicy.md`
file located in the root of any repository under their stewardship.

Note that the Moderation Policy adopted by a Working Group will be evaluated
by the TSC prior to ratifying the WG's proposed charter. If that Code of
Conduct is considered to be weaker than, or diverges too significantly from,
the [ASC Software Organization Moderation Policy][], the TSC may defer accepting the charter until
corrections are made.

Likewise, if the WG's Moderation Policy changes after the WG has already been
chartered and the TSC determines that the updated Moderation Policy is weaker
than, or diverges too significantly from, the [ASC Software Organization Moderation Policy][], the
TSC (or any Collaborator) may request that further corrections be made by
opening an issue or a PR in the WG's repository. Should the WG choose not to
adopt the recommended changes, the TSC may choose to revoke the WGs charter.
