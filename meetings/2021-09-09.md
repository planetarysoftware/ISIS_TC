- Driving more community engagement with RFC process (deprecation)
  - Just had a meeting about ASC long term planning that will require this
  - Making the software notify users about proposed changes
    - Could be intrusive to users
    - Add a warning whenever an application with an open deprecation RFC is run
      - ISIS3 was designed to minimize the standard out messages
      - Feels forceful and aggresive
      - Could go in GUI instead, possibly via web help link
      - Could add a no-notices options and an IsisPreferences option
      - qgis uses a start-up tip-of-the-day message
  - Have a scheduled meeting around each RFC to drive discussion
    - An option for RFC authors
    - TC can facilitate
    - Notes and/or meeting needs to be recorded
  - Limiting RFC life-cycle length
    - Inconsistent in the past
    - Having a known length is helpful for planning and proposal writing
    - Could have a more formal acceptance/rejection process
      - Check-points to ensure things progress forward
    - Some options
      - Have a minimum and then "once discussion has stopped"
      - X time without comments
    - Create an RFC policy document to start working on
  - Maybe add some graphics
    - Could help drive engagement
    - Can be folded into future documentation
    - Videos are also very good for engagement
  - Some "how to write a good RFC" documentation
    - Can be folded into RFC policy documentation
  - Be louder at conferences
    - Posters and talks
    - Openplanetary and other regular talks are another good venue
    - Spam the AGs
    - Social media
  - Use in person/remote training as a way to drive engagement
    - NAIF does a good job of driving engagement from user training
  - Drive more engagement to where the RFCs are
    - Singular hub for tutorials, documentation, and RFCs
    - ISIS website has the highest "google" ranking
    - Github has a new discourse feature that we could use
  - Publish a newsletter
    - Maybe the TC publishes a newsletter every release

- Versioning & Breaking Changes Guidelines
