## Agenda / Notes

- Action Items from last month
  - Jesse: Migrate RFC to Github discussions
    - https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/discussions/4691
    - Response from J 
  - Jesse: Update RFC PR [#4632](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4632) with Github discussion changes

  - Jesse: Post issue on ISIS_TC about who has the authority to rename the software
    - [#148](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS_TC/issues/148)
    - Some management response:
      - Similar to J's LTS response
      - Written stuff is coming
      - Looking to make sure we have a robust adoption of the renaming
      - Need more details
      - Concerns about mitigation and how we handle negative response from the community
        - "You broke my stuff by changing your name!"
      - General the ISIS TC should be discussing this type of change
        - Implementation and details need to be worked out with input from the ASC management
      - This group should do initial fact-finding and exploration
  - Lauren & J: Discuss how we can make an ISIS hub site
    - No capacity at ASC for doing this near-term
    - What the ASC is allowed to do on Github is being worked out still
    - Government employees are very restricted when it comes to publishing
    - Would be a good candidate for the TC to pursue independent of the ASC

- Name changing next steps
  - We need to gather more information from the community
  - Some sort of internal consensus is valuable
  - Deliverables:
    - Conference presentation
      - LPSC townhall? Poster?
    - Survey
      - include context
      - may need to be open for a while to collect a lot of data
        - We are looking for a lot of responses
      - Can be shared at a conference/meeting/etc.
      - Questions:
        - Should we change the name?
    - Deadlines:
      - LPSC is a good target for having a survey and community engagement ready
  - The ASC DEIA council can serve as a psuedo-working group
    - Hash out initial survey and collect data within Astro
    - Come back to TC with data and findings
    - Work with TC to "go wide"
    - Can also go to the mission teams after Astro and then wide
