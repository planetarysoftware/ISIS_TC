## Agenda / Notes

- Action Items from last month
  - Jesse: Create LTS RFC
    - [RFC8](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/wiki/RFC8:-ISIS-LTS)
    - Posted on ISIS wiki
      - Previously discussed moving off the wiki
      - RFC PR says use astrodiscuss
      - Create a new section on astrodiscuss for RFCs that is better for discussions
        - Still requires a github account
      - Could be on discussion on ISIS github repo
        - Announcement on astrodiscuss that links to the discussion on github

  - Jesse: Distribute RFC on Astrosdiscuss, OpenPlanetary, and LPI news
    - On hold
  - Andrew: Distribute RFC on LEAG, MEXAG, SBAG, MEPAG and OPAG
    - On hold
  - J: Distribute RFC on Pen, DPS, and to MAPSIT
    - On hold

  - Andrew: Create RFC.md policy document PR in ISIS
    - PR Up [#4632](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4632)
    - Action Jesse: Update RFC PR with Github discussion changes
    - Take a look at and review

- Driving more community engagement
  - Do we want to add a notification about open RFCs to the software?
    - If so where?
      - Notifications in the GUI are okay
        - Splash pop-up that can be disabled
        - Note on help pages
        - Note on the header/footer of a GUI
      - New GUI program that just links to a bunch of resources that users may find of interest
        - What's going on program
      - Installation notifications could work but may be challenging to implement
      - Notifications in terminal are dangerous for pipelining and wrappers
      - Link in the website header/banner/documentation pages
        - Requires some changes to the current ISIS website
  - Regular communications about what's happening in ISIS
    - Newsletter, blog, etc.
    - Conferences and meetings
    - We've had e-mails in the past
    - ASC folks need to do this through our official channels
      - Challenging for the community to post on official USGS channels
      - Github is a good middle ground
    - Needs to be unified
      - Currently things are split over website, astrodiscuss, and github
      - In general we need a single location for all users to go to
      - Wherever this goes needs to be user friendly
        - Github can be challenging for non-programmer users
        - Github.io could work for this
          - Landing page with links to external sites is okay
          - Users need a hub that they can find everything from
          - gh_pages branch exists https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/tree/gh-pages
          - ASC needs to get this started
            - Open to help from other folks too
            - Would happen sometime this fiscal, likely not in the next month

- Versioning & Breaking Changes Guidelines
  - Pushed to highest priority next meeting

- Open discussion
  - ISIS name change
    - The DEIA council at the ASC is interested in changing the name because it is problematic in some situations
    - More is coming in the future
    - Looking for input on
      - Should this happen?
      - What needs to be considered?
      - What are the alternatives?
    - The current name has massive interia (20+ years worth for ISIS2 and ISIS3+)
      - Will we do better than Prince?
    - Who has the authority to change the name?
    - RFC is probably the next step?
      - Need to determine the authority first
