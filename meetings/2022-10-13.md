## Agenda / Notes

- Action Items from last month

- ISIS Name Change Working Group
  - Waiting for availability

- Discussion of [#167](https://github.com/planetarysoftware/ISIS_TC/issues/167)
  - See previous discussion from August
  - Concerns about releasing ISIS through the USGS as federal scientific software and the impact on contributors and users
    - Further centralization around USGS
      - The majority of work is already done by the USGS
      - As the non-USGS work grows this could move away from the USGS
    - Is every push a release?
      - The dev branch of ISIS is provisionally released
      - Only tagged releases are full scientific software releases
    - Are contributions from USGS employees to non-USGS released scientific software subject to release requirements?
      - Up to the science center director because they shoulder the risk of litigation
    - What specifically about these requirements are imposing difficulty?
      - The USGS requirements are a codified version of standard requirements
      - There is a more formal process to get merge permissions on the repo
        - The policy here is being written right now and we can give some input
      - Only USGS employees can release ISIS
        - Things like government shutdowns and soft funding mean there is a risk that ASC employees may not be able to do this
        - Any can build ISIS
        - Any can create a conda-build tarball for release via Anaconda
        - Data area is more complex
          - we're pushing to not be the sole distributors and it's more pointers to data in public archives
          - Vendor lock in S3 is concerning
            - USGS is contracted to only use S3
            - Anyone else can mirror the data
            - rclone also supports many different hosts if we do want to use a mirror
        - Documentation will likely only be published by the USGS
          - You can still build the docs locally
        - Currently the policy requires that the release be hosted on a .gov source such as the USGS gitlab
          - Right now, the USGS gitlab repo for ISIS is a mirror of the github repo
          - A new update is coming to allow official GitHub organizations
            - This is related to the upcoming migration from the usgs-astrogeology github org to the official USGS github org
    - Is the USGS scientific software release for general use, evolving software or specific software written to support a single publication or project?
      - short vs long term support question
      - Each release of ISIS is a discrete scientific software release, ISIS as a whole is not released
      - The USGS policy was written around write software, write paper, throw away software
        - We can still use the policy even though we, and most people, do not operate this way
    - What about LTS version?
      - LTS version will also be officially released through the USGS software process
      - Can non LTS releases be provisional releases?
        - why?
      - We could separately consider slowing releases down
        - Could also consider versioning data areas so it's easier to work with older versions
          - These are not related to the USGS software release policy
      - The LTS matches better with the USGS software release policy
    - The USGS is the only group releasing ISIS
      - Anyone else can
        - Build a release
        - Build the documentation
        - Modify the rclone config to point their mirror of the data

- ISIS GTest documentation improvements [#5029](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/5029)
  - The USGS is looking for more feedback and contribution from the community
    - Concerns about the approach to feedback and comments
      - Actionable feedback is great, but there is value in other feedback
      - It's important that we build an environment where contributors feel encouraged and not discouraged
      - There have been instances where contributors, and potential contributors, felt like they were not being respected
        - The code of conduct and contributing guidelines should cover everyone being respectful
          - The issue and PR templates do not reference these, maybe they should
        - We currently have no recourse/resolution process if someone thinks these have been violated
        - Calling honest feedback complaining is disrespectful and discouraging
      - General feedback is often not useful
        - "We need better documentation" is not helpful
        - "The homepage should be better because I cannot easily fine XYZ" is helpful
  - There are other issues with gtest documented elsewhere on the repo
    - We need to cross-link/combine these
  - There is a push and pull between maintainers working to improve feedback with contributors and contributors providing better feedback up front
    - There is a balance here that we are not finding in all instances
      - The contribution documents and such need to be better about setting expectations
    - Maintainers feel like contributors are not doing enough and contributors feel like maintainers are not doing enough
  - The external contributor pool is already quite small and we're losing people
  - The USGS devs have been working to put what they have learned into the documentation.
