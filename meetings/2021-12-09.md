## Agenda / Notes

- Action Items from last month
  - Jesse: Migrate old RFCs and RFC template from Wiki to Discussions
    - Add to RFC.md and update relevant links
    - Andrew PR: https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4632
      - More reviews
    - Need more comments on issue https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/discussions/4691
  - Jesse: Distribute RFC on Astrosdiscuss, OpenPlanetary, and LPI news
     - Unknown
  - Andrew: Distribute RFC on LEAG, MEXAG, SBAG, MEPAG and OPAG
     - Waiting on Jesse to write a blurb
     - Andrew in middle of Dissertation, someone take over?
       - Will discuss take over when blurb is written
  - J: Distribute RFC on Pen, DPS, and to MAPSIT
     - Still waiting
  - Victor & Andrew: Post issue on ISIS TC about improving docs for users
      - Victors team is putting together comments
      - Andrew opened issue #151 on ISIS_TC (https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS_TC/issues/151)
  - Jesse: Go back to the ASC DEIA council and start working on an ASC survey
    - Survery has been released internal to ASC
    - Next step is to move to external distribution
    - Additional Comments
      - Victor: do we want to put something together for LPSC?
      - Ross: intention is to use internal ASC survey as draft for external >> promote at LPSC

- Versioning & Breaking Changes Guidelines

- Long Term Support
  - Victors is going to publish adoption plan soon
     - Good precedence; good sized user group
     - Catalyst for other groups
     - Kris Becker has comments
  - Conversation has stalled on https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS_TC/issues/145
     - Good conversation, but no conclusion 
     - What does finished look like?
       - Talked theory and understanding built to open a PR
       - If converstation has stalled, PR is next step 
       - Kris has concerns about affects plug ins have to versioning
       - Currently breaking / versioning is ad hoc
     - Conclusion is not reached, need to have a discussion in meeting?
       - Implimentation
         - Camera Model / Plug in initial introduction are not final 
           - Is it the keys in the PVL or the column in the CSVs changing?
           - If the camera model update change output values (or orientation of an image).. does this require a version tick?
              - have a similar affect as updating SPICE
              - would cause an update in the camera model..does it trail out to ISIS version?
              - No, different parts of the code move at different velocities doesnt work to tie them all together
                 - Adds coplexity, but it is the reality
              - How do the users get access to the new CM version
                 - Does not always line up with ISIS version ticks
           - Real World example
              - Rossetta camera model does not work with noprog. To fix, had to change orientation of image which caused label keys to change
                - Major version change of camera model
              - Cannot grab old camera version with cutting edge ISIS version
                - install of ISIS and camera plug-in versions could be better broken up?
                  - Camera model version is just a single line of information
                     - could have as a dependency; adds complexity
                     - implicit versioning of CM (newest at time of release)
                  - Camera model updates are infrequent and improvments
                     - Would users ever want to use old version of the camera?
                     - managing the CI and release of camera plug-in separately would be a lot of work
              - Are all versioning changes (including camera model version changes) requiring an RFC
         - Kris to post on issue whether there is a removal of keys in the PVLs (values are not part of API; adding keys does not break)
           - This is a good real world example


- Open discussion
  - Is Thursday meeting permanent? It was initially a temporary thing, but it has been months
     - Tuesday are big meeting days elsewhere
     - "permanently" moved to Thrusday

## Discussions for next meeting
