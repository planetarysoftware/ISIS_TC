    - Big checklist being build, please leave any feedback on this issue

- ISIS Name Change Working Group

    - Many people are very busy right now

- Open discussion
  - ALE/CSM releases
    - CSM coming this week
    - ALE still soon (tm)
      - In the middle of big development that should be ending
  - Release requirements
    - Can ISIS be a provisional software release?
      - To be on the USGS GitHub it must be scientific software
         ISIS can only remain on GitHub if it moves to the USGS GitHub
    - Much of this is outside of the ASC's control
    - Scientific software releases impose extra overhead for contributors
      - Also limits committers
      - It is very hard to transition to a true open-source eco-system with these restrictions
        - There will need to be large contributions outside of the ASC/USGS to get away from releasing through these channels
    - Concerns about ISIS being available and supported in light of requirements
      - ASC is working very hard to make sure that ISIS is available and supported no matter the requirements from above us
      - The Planetary Data Ecosystem that has been much discussed will be limited by requirements like this
    - Limits the power of the TC
      - TC is soft power now because only government employees can commit
      - ASC has take official responsibility for ISIS releases
  - rsync going away [#5026](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/5026)
    - shutting down November 30, 2022
    - new data download script
      - If you encounter any problems please let us know so we can fix them asap
