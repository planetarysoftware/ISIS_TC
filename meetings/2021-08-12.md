## Agenda / Notes

- Discussion of LTS issues.
  - Tentative plan described in June
    - Good to move forward
    - Need to get this drafted, and open for full comments from community
    - Communicate broadly
      - Post on OpenPlanetary
      - Post in Pen
      - Post on -AG lists
    - ASC needs to go to NASA to get approval on some ASC/NASA contract stuff
      - Will happen after RFC process completes
    - RFC time period
      - 2 months

- Versioning & Breaking Changes Guidelines (Ross)
  - Discussion of Hist change and impact
  - Need for an actionable policy
  - Delay until Ross has time to draft something

- [JPEG 2000 RFC](https://astrodiscuss.usgs.gov/t/rfc-7-evaluate-use-of-jpeg2000-in-isis/713)
  - Only used in isis2std and std2isis
  - Other tools like GDAL cover this functionality
    - Discussion of what the best driving library is best, libjpeg or turbo
    - We can let maintainers of these other tools figure this out
  - KAKADU may be completely removable
    - How do we deprecate?
      - Deprecation warnings
      - Add to release notes
      - Set a date/version that it will be removed at
      - May not be a deprecation, but could be slower
      - Also could have an impact on dependencies
  - For other changes like this do we want to use the RFC process like KAKADU?
    - Need an RFC for community discussion about if something should be deprecated
      - Could insert a warning into the code that we are considering making a deprecation
      - Need to drive community input
      - Need to get the community used to looking at the new places we are using
    - Then contributors can move ahead with deprecation if the RFC decides that
  - Post that the RFC will close in X time if there are no further comments
  - After RFC closes post issue on ISIS to deprecate KAKADU

## Discussions for next meeting
